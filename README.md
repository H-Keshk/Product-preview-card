## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Web-first workflow
- Media Queries


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Website](https:///getbootstrap.com/) - That website helping me a lot through my road; In this project, I used it to give me the perfect screen sizes (Breakpoints) so I can make a neat responsive layout with right dimentions.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Some times there's a specific code I spend so many time to debug it, and I just need a second brain to give a tip, and for that I use ChatGPT from time to time and adapt his ideas to my code line.
